#The Prisoners problem involves 2n Prisoners trying their luck to be set free from prison.
#There are a total of 2n boxes presented to each prisoner. These boxes contain cards numbered 
#1 to 2n arranged at random. Each prisoner can open at most 'n' boxes to find his number. 
#Each prisoner makes their choice on their own, and can't discuss what they do with the others.
#After each prisoner makes their choices the cards are returned to the boxes they were in before
#the prisoner did anything.
#If all prisoners find their numbers then they all go free, if even one doesn't get their
#number then they are all killed. 
#This code analyses some strategies the prisoners can take to find the best way for them to
#all escape.

#The Prisoners problem is carried out as follows:

#The p() function does the simulation of the events based on the strategy
#We may loop over it 'nreps' number if times
#The p() function does the simulation of the events based on the strategy
#We may loop over it 'nreps' number if times

  #Strategy 3 is dealt with at the else block

    } else if (strategy==2) { 
      #As Strategy 2 says, we need to start with a random numbered box 
      #We use sample() to generate a random number
      box_to_open <- boxes[sample(1:(2*n), 1)] 
    }
    #attempts is initialized to 0 and will be incremented on each term
    attempts <- 0            
    
    #This simulates checking boxes for at most 'n' attempts using the while loop  
    #The loop ends if the box contains the card with the Prisoner's number (k) 
    while (box_to_open != k) {
      if (attempts == n) {    #If attempts=n, the Prisoner ran out of attempts

#What was surprising about the results?

#Strategies 1 and 2 were very interesting comparisons! 
#We were curious as to how Strategy 1 was the most efficient and had the highest success Probability in both cases.
#We were especially amazed on how the success rate of Strategy 2 was lower compared to Strategy 1 considering that
#the only difference was that we began with a Random box, compared to starting with a box with the Prisoner's number 
#on it, as done in Strategy 1. The starting box made a difference! 
#Strategy 3 for 1 Prisoner had really high Success rate and came close to matching Strategy 1. But as the
#number of prisoners increased (n=5 and then n=50), it only got worse and was eventually rendered least efficient.
